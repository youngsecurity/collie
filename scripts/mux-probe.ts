// THE LIVE LAYER of mux conformance — the same checks, against a REAL multiplexer.
//
//   bun scripts/mux-probe.ts                 # every registered adapter
//   bun scripts/mux-probe.ts --mux herdr     # just one
//   COLLIE_MUX_ENDPOINT_TMUX=/tmp/tmux-1000/default bun scripts/mux-probe.ts --mux tmux
//
// WHY IT EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `bun test bridge/mux`. The pure layer drives every adapter through a
// fake transport, which is what lets it run with no multiplexer installed — and is also exactly what
// it cannot prove: real escape sequences, real id shapes, real resize behaviour, real timing. Memory
// `collie-live-probe-harness` records the trap this avoids — a "live" probe that is really talking to
// a fixture proves less than nothing, because it reads as evidence.
//
// IT ONLY EVER RUNS {@link MUX_READ_ONLY_CHECKS}, and that is not a limitation to lift later. A live
// pane is somebody's work session: a probe that typed into one, renamed one or closed one would be a
// tool nobody could safely run. Calls to UNDECLARED capabilities are in the read-only set because
// they refuse before they touch anything — which is the property being probed.
//
// IT SKIPS LOUDLY. An adapter whose multiplexer is not on this box prints why, in full, and does not
// count as a pass. The exit code is non-zero only when a REACHABLE multiplexer failed a check —
// "not installed" is an answer, not a failure.
