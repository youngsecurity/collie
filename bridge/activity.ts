// its pane records carry no timestamps at all (HERDR_API.md) — so Collie derives and owns both.
//
// Two numbers per pane are enough for the whole dashboard:
//   • activeAt — the last agent status transition this bridge observed
//   • seenAt   — the last time you opened or drove the pane THROUGH COLLIE
//
// "Unseen" is then a comparison, not a stored fact: an agent is newly-finished-and-unread exactly
// when `status === "done" && activeAt > seenAt`. Opening the pane sets seenAt = now, and the row
// leaves the section on its own — nothing to mark read, nothing to keep in sync.
//
// Bridge-side and shared across devices on purpose, and deliberately blind to what you do at the
// desk in Herdr itself — see .adr/0003-one-shared-seen.md. Persisted to the state dir like Snooze
// and NotifyPrefsStore, so it survives the `systemctl restart` every backend change needs.

 * not). Since those frames advance on every poll, binding a row's label to it makes every working

 * back to the process name, so an agent that sets no title reports `claude`), or the workspace
 * label that is line one of every row. Case-insensitive, because neither comparison is about case.
 *
 * A shell's locator title (`altan@bluefin:~/projects/collie`) is dropped for the same reason: it is
 * not what the process is doing, it is a restatement of the cwd the row already carries on that very
 * line — longer, and rewritten on every `cd`. Dropped unconditionally rather than only when the path
 * matches: the row's cwd is the fresher of the two (a locator only updates at the next prompt), and
