// THE TMUX WATCH — how "tell me to look again" is kept over a multiplexer with no socket.
//
// The contract's promise is small and it is the whole of what this file owes: after something
// changes, a callback fires within the adapter's stated bound, and a notification is a hint to
// RE-READ rather than state (../types.ts § MuxWatchOptions). tmux can keep that promise two ways and
// this watch uses both, because neither alone covers the herd:
//
//  • **Control mode — the push.** `tmux -C attach-session -t $N` is tmux's documented control
//    protocol; it streams `%output %<pane> …` for that session's panes and `%window-add`,
//    `%window-renamed`, `%sessions-changed` and friends for structure (probed, M10/04). That is what
//    the two `push*Events` capabilities declare, and it is a real stream, not a poll wearing a hat.
//
//  • **A bounded census poll — the backstop, and the documented fallback.** Probed limitation: a
//    control client only reports `%output` for panes of the session it is ATTACHED to. Writing into
//    a pane of another session produced nothing. So one client is not a server-wide stream, and the
//    watch attaches one per session — capped, because a client is a real tmux client and an
//    unbounded fan-out over a busy server is a cost the operator never asked for. Above the cap, and
//    whenever no client is up at all, {@link RESYNC_MS} closes the gap: one cheap listing, compared
//    against the last, and a topology callback when it moved. That is also what makes `watch()` work
//    on a tmux too old for control mode — the adapter degrades to a poll rather than going dark.
//
// TWO CLIENT FLAGS ARE LOAD-BEARING and they live in protocol.ts `controlArgs`: `ignore-size` (a
// control client is a real client, and without it every window in the session is squeezed to the
// watcher's 80×24) and `read-only` (this connection can never type; writes go through `send-keys`,
// where the routes' gates already are).
//
// LIFECYCLE IS THIS FILE'S, ENTIRELY. `close()` kills every child and is idempotent; `onDown` fires
// exactly once, on close or on a tmux that stopped answering. A single session's client dying is not
// the watch dying — it is dropped and the next resync re-attaches it.
