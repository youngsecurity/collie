// THE ZELLIJ WATCH — a HYBRID, and the most load-bearing design decision in this adapter.
//
// The contract's promise is small and it is the whole of what this file owes: after something
// changes, a callback fires within the adapter's stated bound, and a notification is a hint to
// RE-READ rather than state (../types.ts § MuxWatchOptions). zellij can keep half of that promise
// with a real push and cannot keep the other half at all, so the watch does both:
//
//  • **Content — a real stream.** `zellij subscribe --ansi --format json --pane-id <id> …` follows
//    several panes at once and pushes newline-delimited JSON on every repaint (probed, M10/05:
//    `{"event":"pane_update","is_initial":true,"pane_id":"terminal_2","viewport":[…]}`). That is what
//    `pushPaneEvents` declares, and it is a stream, not a poll wearing a hat.
//
//  • **Topology — a bounded, adaptive census.** NOTHING in zellij's CLI announces a pane being
//    created or a tab being renamed. Searched and failed to find one: `zellij action --help` has no
//    watch/event verb, `zellij watch` is a read-only ATTACH (a whole TUI, not a feed), and `zellij
//    pipe` needs a WASM plugin on the other end — the plugin API is where such an event lives, and a
//    plugin is not a CLI surface. So the census below is the only source, `pushTopologyEvents` is
//    declared ABSENT, and the poll's cadence is part of the spec rather than an implementation
//    detail (M10/05).
//
// ── THE ONE TOPOLOGY FACT THE STREAM DOES CARRY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `{"event":"pane_closed","pane_id":"terminal_3"}` — probed, followed by the stream exiting once
// nothing is left to follow. A pane the operator is LOOKING AT going away is the topology change
// they notice soonest, so it is reported immediately and the census is pulled back to its floor. It
// covers only followed panes, which is why it shortens the poll rather than replacing it.
//
// ── THE CADENCE, AND WHY IT IS THESE TWO NUMBERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every census is a `zellij` process: a fork, an exec and a round trip to the session. A fixed fast
// poll spends that forever on a herd nobody is changing; a fixed slow one makes a new pane appear
// late. So it is adaptive in exactly the way the frontend's own poller already is
// (`web/src/hooks/use-polling.ts`, hot 1.5 s → cold 4 s): it runs at {@link ZELLIJ_CENSUS_MIN_MS}
// after any change and doubles up to {@link ZELLIJ_CENSUS_MAX_MS} while nothing moves.
//
// Both ends are chosen against something. The floor is 3 s rather than the frontend's 1.5 s because
// a census here costs a process rather than a fetch, and topology changes at human speed. The
// ceiling is 12 s because that is `COLLIE_POLL_IDLE_MS`, the bridge's own relaxed cadence — a caller
// that read `pushTopologyEvents: false` and relaxed to its idle floor is never worse off than the
// watch backing it.
//
// LIFECYCLE IS THIS FILE'S, ENTIRELY. `close()` kills the stream and drops every timer and is
// idempotent; `onDown` fires exactly once, on close or on a session that stopped answering. The
// stream ending is NOT the watch ending — it is re-established at the next census if the panes are
// still there, which is also how the watch recovers when the operator restarts their session.

// ── THE SECOND PAIR OF NUMBERS: while somebody is actually looking ───────────────────────────────
//
// The two above are the cadence for a host nobody is watching, and they are chosen against a cost:
// a census is a process. But that trade changes completely the moment a phone is polling — the
// operator is in front of the screen, the herd is already costing a snapshot poll every 1.5 s, and
// a tab they renamed in their own terminal taking twelve seconds to appear reads as Collie being
// broken rather than Collie being frugal.
//
// So the watch asks (`MuxWatchOptions.attention`) and runs the SAME adaptive algorithm between a
// tighter pair. It stays adaptive rather than pinning to the floor: a herd nobody is changing is
// quiet whether or not it is being watched, and doubling out to 3 s costs the operator nothing they
// can perceive.
//
// The floor is the frontend's own hot cadence, and the ceiling is that cadence doubled — the point
// past which a change would outlive two of the phone's polls and start reading as a stale screen.
// `topologyLatency` still declares the IDLE ceiling, because a declaration must be the bound that
// always holds and attention is not something a caller can promise (adapter.ts).
