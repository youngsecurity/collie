// ── SPEECH-TO-TEXT: ONE SEAM, ONE SHAPE, NOTHING ABOUT A VENDOR ──────────────────────────────
//
// The bridge knows exactly this much about transcription: bytes of a completed recording go in,
// one string comes out, and a provider can say ahead of time whether it is usable at all. Every
// vendor detail — base URL, model, credential, wire format — lives behind an implementation of
// {@link SttProvider} and is never named on the route, in the snapshot, or on the phone.
//
// The seam is deliberately narrow so `bun test` covers all of it: nothing here opens a socket,
// reads a file or touches `Bun.serve`. The one implementation that talks to a network takes its
// `fetch` as a parameter (bridge/stt/openai.ts), which is what makes the whole provider testable
// under Bun's runner rather than only through a live endpoint.
