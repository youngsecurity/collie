// The cursor: one opaque token that says where a source got to, in that source's own language.
//
// ── WHY ONE CODEC AND NOT THREE SHAPES ───────────────────────────────────────
// The contract is `readSince(key, cursor)`, and the three storage kinds under it count position
// differently: a byte offset for the five harnesses that write a file, `max(time_updated)` for
// opencode's rows (which it mutates while a reply streams), and `max(id)` for hermes' append-only
// ones. Every one of those is ONE non-negative integer, so the shape they share is worth more than
// the names they don't. A single text token carries it, and the number's MEANING never leaves the
// adapter that wrote it.
//
// ── THE THREE FIELDS ARE THE THREE WAYS A CURSOR IS WRONG ────────────────────
// `<tag>:<position>:<keyHash>`
//
//  - `tag` — which counting this is. A cursor from another storage kind is REFUSED rather than
//    misread. A pane whose agent changed under a window that kept its cursor is what produces one.
//  - `position` — the number. Digits only, so a corrupted or hand-made token can never arrive as a
//    negative (which `Bun.file().slice` reads from the END of the file), a float, or `1e9`.
//  - `keyHash` — which source it was taken on. This is what makes Claude's hand-over free: when a
//    conversation rotates, `resolve` starts answering with a different path, the hash stops
//    matching, and the read resets. No hand-over code lives in the cursor at all. The same field
//    covers an opencode session that moved database.
//
// The key is HASHED, not carried. A cursor is positioning and never authority, so identity is the
// only question asked of this field, and a hash answers it while keeping an operator's home
// directory out of a value the live window may log or put on the wire. Refusing a cursor is always
// the safe direction: the read resets, which shows the operator their session again rather than
// less of it.
