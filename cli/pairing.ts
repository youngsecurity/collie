// `pair`, `devices list`, `devices revoke` — the operator's half of device pairing. The pure
// decisions all live in `bridge/pairing.ts`; this module is the terminal, the two files under the
// state dir, and the words an operator reads.
//
// ── WHY THE TERMINAL MINTS THE CODE, AND NOT THE WEB UI ──────────────────────
// Enrolment is a bootstrap problem: the phone asking to be paired is, by definition, the one party
// that cannot yet prove anything — it holds no token, and the header gate (if configured at all) only
// says what the network asserts about it. A "pair this device" button in Collie's own UI would
// therefore be authorised by nothing, and would hand a write credential to whoever loaded the page.
// The operator's shell on the host IS the proof: reaching it already implies the access pairing is
// there to fence off. So the code is minted where that proof already exists and carried out of band —
// eyes, from a terminal to a phone keyboard — and the UI's only job is to spend it.
//
// The same reasoning runs the other way for revocation: a lost phone is revoked from the machine, not
// from the phone. `devices revoke` needs no service restart — the bridge re-reads
// `paired-devices.json` per request (`readRegistrySync` in bridge/pairing.ts), so the device loses
// write access on its very next call.
