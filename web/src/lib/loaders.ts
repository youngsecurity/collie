// React Router data loaders are the data layer — there is intentionally no separate data-fetching
// library. The home/detail routes declare these as `loader`s; polling is just
// `useRevalidator().revalidate()` re-running them (see hooks/use-polling.ts). Each loader keeps the
// last good result in a module cache so a transient fetch failure shows stale-but-present data
// (flagged) instead of flashing empty — i.e. keep-previous-data while a refetch is in flight.
//
// Offline fast path (a PWA should navigate instantly to last-known data): during a KNOWN, escalated
// outage (the shared connection-health store has latched "lost"), a NAVIGATION must not block on a
// fetch that will only time out — it returns cached data immediately (flagged error). A REVALIDATION
// (the poll) must keep really fetching so recovery is discovered and the stale data swapped out. React
// Router never tells a loader which kind of run it is, but the request URL does: a revalidation re-runs
// a loader at the SAME url; a navigation runs it at a DIFFERENT one (see isNavigation below). No timer,
// no flag, no race — and because a navigation aborts any in-flight revalidation, the nav is instant
// even while a poll's doomed fetch is still hanging.
