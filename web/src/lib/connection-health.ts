// The ONE connection-health clock, shared by every consumer (the header pill, the outage banner, the
// in-pane header, the boot splash). Module-scoped store in the lib/busy.ts + lib/server-build.ts
// idiom — plain module state + a subscribe + a useSyncExternalStore hook — so escalation is derived
// from a SINGLE source of truth that no remount, route change, or per-instance timer can fork.
//
// Why this exists: escalation used to live in a per-COMPONENT ref/timer (useConnectionLost stamped a
// local `since` when it first saw `connecting`). Two independent instances could diverge — most
// visibly, the pill renders inside each route's header, so navigating home→space mid-outage REMOUNTED
// it and restarted its clock, while the banner (in the persistent RootLayout) escalated on time. The
// result on-device: the banner went red "not connected" while the header pill sat amber
// "reconnecting…" for far longer. Anchoring every consumer on this shared store fixes that by
// construction.
//
// Anchor semantics: `lastLiveAt` is the wall-clock of the last PROVABLY LIVE moment — stamped when a
// snapshot/pane fetch returns genuinely live data (see lib/api.ts; a 304 counts as live). `lastWakeAt`
// is stamped when the tab returns to the foreground. Escalation measures a flat CONNECTION_LOST_MS of
// no live data from `max(lastLiveAt, lastWakeAt)`: anchoring on the last SUCCESS means device delays
// (a 10s fetch timeout, a poll gap) can no longer stack BEFORE the clock starts, and the wake anchor
// gives a phone waking from sleep a fresh grace window instead of an instant red flash while its first
// poll is still in flight.
//
// Sticky escalation (`lostLatched`): the wake grace above is honest ONLY before we've escalated. Once
// the app is already showing "not connected" (red pill + banner) and the user switches apps and comes
// back MID-OUTAGE, the wake stamp used to reset the anchor to now and downgrade red → amber
// "reconnecting…" for another full window, even though nothing had changed — a dishonest de-escalation.
// So we LATCH the escalated state: `latchLost()` is called the moment a real connecting consumer
// observes `lost` (see use-connection-lost), and while latched `effectiveAnchor()` DROPS the wake grace
// (measures from `lastLiveAt` alone). Red therefore stays red across backgrounding until the connection
// proves itself — the latch clears ONLY when `markLive()` stamps a genuine live poll, at which point the
// live stamp and the latch clear together and everything recovers as before. The latch is coupled to a
// consumer actually crossing the threshold (not merely the wall-clock going stale) because the anchor
// can go stale for benign reasons too — e.g. the idle-lock pausing polling — where nobody is
// `connecting` and no red UI is showing, so nothing should latch.

// How long the app must stay continuously not-live before we escalate from the quiet header pill
// ("reconnecting…") to a prominent prompt. Long enough that a normal poll blip, a pane-open hiccup,
// or a brief tunnel drop never trips it — only a genuinely sustained outage does.

// How long the app must stay continuously not-live before the connection bar fades IN as an ambient

// flashes a bar — the flicker fix. Measured from the SAME shared anchor as CONNECTION_LOST_MS (via
// useConnectionTrouble), just far shorter and, crucially, NON-latching: only the 15s escalation latches.
