// The generic-menu tap — the same guard as its siblings (lib/dialog-guard.ts), with the one
// judgement call this grammar forces:
//
//   - ACTION keys (Enter / s / whatever the footer named) COMMIT. In the `/model` picker, Enter
//     writes the user's default for new sessions. These take the full `commits` comparison — a
//     highlight that moved between render and tap changes the signature, so a stale tap is refused.
//   - NAV keys (Up/Down/Left/Right) only move a highlight. They take the same fresh read but compare
//     the menu's IDENTITY (title + the keys it offers, and NOT the ←/→ row's live label) — because
//     moving the highlight is precisely what changes the signature, so a signature check would make
//     the second arrow tap in a row always fail. Nothing is committed, so identity is enough.
//
// Both semantics live in harness/menu-model.ts (menusEqual / menusSameIdentity) and are wired to this
// kind by harness/dialog-contract.ts; `nav` just picks which one the guard runs.
