// cohorts are derived from the byte-faithful corpus (web/src/fixtures/panes/claude--*.txt) by
// GLOBBING it, so a newly-captured dialog is covered the moment it lands — including the multiSelect
// captures whose block may still be wiring up (a not-yet-detecting own fixture is tolerated by the
// suite, see conformance.ts).
//
// The FOREIGN cohort is the omp corpus — the second adapter's captures. Until it existed this leg was
// vacuous (`foreignFixtures: []`), so "an adapter must stay raw on another harness's screens" was a
// documented promise nothing checked. Claude's grammars return raw-only on all 20 omp captures today,
// and the mirror-image assertion lives in harness/omp.test.ts.
