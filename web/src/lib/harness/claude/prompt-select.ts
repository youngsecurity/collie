// Prompt-select detection — the grammar that recognises a Claude Code single-choice dialog sitting
// at the TAIL of a pane buffer (AskUserQuestion selects, permission prompts, the folder-trust
// prompt, and plan approval) and lifts it into a `PromptModel` the UI renders as native buttons.
//
// Everything here is a PURE function over `StyledLine[]`, driven entirely by the fixture corpus
// (web/src/fixtures/panes/*.txt). It never touches a pane or the network. The tail invariant is the
// backbone: the dialog's footer hint bar is the LAST non-blank line of the buffer, so a menu that
// has scrolled up (with real output below it) simply doesn't match — the false-positive guard.

// a false "changed" (over-wide capture) is a harmless refresh, whereas a false match types a
// keystroke into a terminal — so we err wide.
