// Chrome stripping — trims the agent's own TUI chrome off the TAIL of a parsed buffer so the app's
// composer/statusline supersedes it instead of duplicating it. Today that's the Claude Code input
// box (the "❯ …" prompt line sandwiched between two rules) plus the statusline / hint lines below it
// and any trailing blank runs.
//
// Deliberately CONSERVATIVE: it strips only when the WHOLE input-box shape matches confidently at
// the tail, and never removes content above it — when unsure it returns the buffer untouched (the
// T1 raw-mirror fallback). Pure; operates on parsed line text, so a user-configured statusline is
// matched by POSITION (below the box's bottom border), never by its content strings.

// unboundedly — it guards less than it looks, and mirrors MAX_FOOTER_LINES: see ADR 0004.

// A newer Claude Code UI paints a "background agents" footer BELOW the statusline/hint, separated from
// them by a blank line: a bold "● main" header and one row per background agent
// ("◯ <agent>  <task…>   <elapsed> · ↓ <tokens>"). We peel it off the tail as chrome too, bounded to
// this many rows (header + a handful of agents, plus a possible "… +N more" line) so a borderless
// buffer still can't strip unboundedly — an over-long block just falls back to the raw mirror.

// no leading "❯") before the bottom border. We scan up past those to find the prompt, bounded by
// MAX_DRAFT_LINES — but as DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH, not a correctness bound. The caller's read window
// defaults to 200 lines (COLLIE_READ_LINES, bridge/config.ts) and is client-requestable up to
// MAX_READ_LINES (10,000, bridge/server.ts), so an unbounded walk would let a stray line that happens
// to look like a border (see isBoxBorder in markers.ts) pair up with an unrelated quoted "❯" line
// dozens (or thousands) of lines further up to complete a full (bogus) box shape — the cap, not the
// border test alone, is what keeps that match from reaching all the way there. Every line the walk
// crosses counts against this cap, blank or not: a run of blank padding is not a free pass either
// (see the blank-line skips inside locateInputBox below, both bounded by the same counter). The OLD
// cap (12) was simply too tight: a real 610-char/25-line CJK draft wraps to ~40 rows at a narrow
// pane's column count (CJK glyphs are 2 cells wide), well past it, which made locateInputBox return
// null and stalled the send guard for good (issue #76). Removing the cap entirely was considered and
// rejected for the reason above. 100 comfortably covers the observed ~40-row case plus a worst case
// around 70–80 rows at a 19-column pane, with margin, while still capping how far the walk can reach.

 * POSITIONAL only: every non-blank line strictly below the box's bottom border and above where the
 * background-agents footer starts (locateInputBox draws that line, so the footer never leaks in
 * here). Returns the rows STYLED, top to bottom, or `[]` when there's no input box at the tail (a
 * menu is up, or a non-Claude / torn buffer). Never interprets the content — the caller renders it
 * verbatim.
 *
 * Styled, not flattened, because a statusline is colour-carrying by design: the model, the context
 * meter and the git branch are told apart by colour before they're read. Flattening to text here
 * threw that away one call before the strip that renders it. The caller draws these in the mirror's
 * dark space (see mirror-space.ts) — terminal colour only means what it means against a dark
