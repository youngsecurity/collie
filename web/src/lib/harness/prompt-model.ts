// The PROMPT-SELECT MODEL — the harness-NEUTRAL payload of a `prompt-select` Block.
//
// A single-choice dialog: a question, a list of options, and the family whose verified keystroke
// recipe each option's `keys` already encodes. Any adapter can produce one; the renderer
// (components/prompt-select-block.tsx) and the race guard (lib/prompt-action.ts → lib/dialog-guard.ts)
// are written against these types alone, never against a harness's internals.
//
// Types + the pure IDENTITY COMPARATOR, no detection and no harness conventions. Claude's reference
// detector is harness/claude/prompt-select.ts. This module imports nothing, so `lib/blocks.ts` can
// re-export it without a cycle.

/** The single-choice dialog families a harness can report, discriminated by its footer hint bar.
 *  The family is what pins the keystroke recipe (digit-then-Enter vs digit alone), so it is part of
 *  the neutral contract even though today only Claude's footers are classified. */

 * `❯` pointer onto it and focuses the field. Modelled rather than merely dropped because both of its
 * variables change what every OTHER row's digit does, and the phone has to see that:
 *
 *   - `focused` — while `❯` sits on the row the field owns the keyboard, and the dialog routes every
 *     digit into it AS TEXT instead of answering. No button on this dialog can fire.
 *   - `text` — what the box holds. Empty (the row shows its placeholder) is the only state Collie
 *     will type into: re-entering a non-empty field puts the caret at position 0, so our text would
 *     be PREPENDED to a sentence someone else is mid-way through writing.
 *
 * Both were measured a keystroke at a time against Claude Code 2.1.228 — see
