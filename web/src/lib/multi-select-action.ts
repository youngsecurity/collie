// The multi-select action recipes — the generic race guard (lib/dialog-guard.ts) plus the extra
// verified steps this dialog needs, because its Submit is a CLOSED-LOOP choreography (never a blind
// Enter):
//
//   - A digit TOGGLES its option on/off (pointer-independent, deterministic). "Chat about this"
//     aborts the tool. The review screen's 1/2 submit/cancel. Each of these is one guarded keystroke.
//   - Submit (checkbox → review) is the hard case: Enter activates the POINTED row, NOT a global
//     submit, and Down CLAMPS at the bottom ("Chat about this") with "Submit" exactly one row above
//     it. So the deterministic macro is: clamp Down to the bottom → Up once → VERIFY the pointer sits
//     on "Submit" → only then Enter. The pointer is re-derived from a fresh read at every step, so a
//     checkbox flip / dialog change mid-macro aborts BEFORE any Enter.
//
// Every flow starts with the same entry guard as the sibling actions (lib/dialog-guard.ts): a FRESH
// pane read, the unconditional revision check, and a re-derivation THROUGH THE PANE'S ADAPTER compared
// against what the user tapped (Herdr 0.7.x's revision is a stub — the re-derivation is the
// load-bearing check). The mid-flight reads re-derive the same way, keyed on the
// pointer-independent-but-not-checkbox-independent `multiSelectIdentity` so the macro's own Down/Up
// moves don't read as drift while a box flipped by another device does. Both comparators are the
// neutral contract in harness/multi-select-model.ts, wired to this kind by harness/dialog-contract.ts.
