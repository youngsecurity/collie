/**
 * Pointer-based long-press. Spread the returned handlers onto the element you want to long-press
 * (`<button {...useLongPress(open)} />`). `pointerdown` arms a timer; movement past `moveTolerance`,
 * or `pointerup`/`pointercancel`/`pointerleave`, cancels it. When it fires we set a one-shot flag and
 * suppress the click that follows on release (via a capture-phase `onClickCapture` that stops the
 * event before the element's own `onClick`) — so a long-press opens the sheet WITHOUT also navigating.
 *
 * Mobile robustness: the naive timer alone failed on real phones. iOS Safari fires the text-selection
 * loupe / touch callout and then `pointercancel`, killing the timer before it fires; Android Chrome
 * raises `contextmenu` at the end of a long-press. So callers must ALSO set `-webkit-touch-callout:
 * none` + `select-none` on the element (stops the iOS gestures that cause the premature cancel), and
 * we treat `contextmenu` as an ALTERNATIVE trigger here (`onContextMenu`) — it opens the sheet even
 * when a native cancel beat the hold timer, and preventDefaults the native menu. `fire` is idempotent
 * per gesture so the timer and the contextmenu path can never double-open.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT set `touch-action: none`: the element stays scrollable, and a scroll gesture
 * cancels the timer through the move/cancel path instead. Pass `onLongPress: undefined` to disable
 * (the handlers become inert) so a caller can conditionally opt out without breaking the hook rules.
