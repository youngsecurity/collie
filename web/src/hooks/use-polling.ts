 * nothing but revalidate — which re-reads the BRIDGE's snapshot, and the bridge's snapshot is only
 * as fresh as the multiplexer census behind it. Under an adapter that censuses, a tab opened while
 * the phone was in a pocket could therefore be up to its declared bound old at the very instant the
 * operator looked (ADR 0031).
 *
 * The refresh is fired and NOT awaited before the revalidation, deliberately. Awaiting it would make
 * every foreground a two-round-trip wait before anything on screen moved, to save a fraction of one
 * poll interval — the revalidation that follows the refresh's own poke is the one that carries the
 * change, and it arrives on its own. What the operator sees is the current data at once and the
 * corrected data a beat later, rather than a blank beat and then both.
