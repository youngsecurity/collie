// or two the just-typed text sits alone on the "❯" line, shape-identical to a stranded draft. At the
// hot poll cadence (≤1.5s) this span means the same text was seen across at least two consecutive
// polls before it can chip; a genuinely stranded draft persists across turns, so it still surfaces —

 * Debounce the raw per-snapshot terminal draft (extractInputDraft) into one that only becomes

 *
 * extractInputDraft is stateless per snapshot (by design — it must stay that way; it's the XSS
 * boundary's neighbour and a pure parse), so it can't tell a genuinely stranded draft from a
 * transient one. This is the cross-poll memory that does: a changed draft resets the clock, and a
 * cleared line (null) drops it immediately.
 *
 * Stability is keyed on the NORMALISED draft (trim + collapse whitespace runs), NOT the raw string:
 * the mirror can re-flow spacing, pad a trailing space, or blink a cursor on the "❯" line between
 * polls, and if every such cosmetic wobble reset the 1.5s clock the chip would never promote for a
 * draft the user is actually staring at. Only a real edit (different text once normalised) restarts
 * the timer. The value we ultimately surface is the LATEST raw text, so the chip shows exactly what's
 * on the line — the normalisation governs the *timer*, not what's displayed.

 * True when a terminal draft is (robustly) the same text the composer just sent — i.e. our own reply

 * exactly after whitespace-normalisation, or when the mirror's copy is a truncated head of what we
 * sent (a long reply gets an "…" ellipsis on the input line) — guarded by a minimum length so a stray
 * short prefix can't false-match an unrelated draft.
 *
 * `carriesSend` is the SAME supplemental evidence the reply guard consults (the pane adapter's
 * `draftCarriesSend`), threaded in by the caller rather than imported: this module is harness-neutral
 * and must stay that way — the composer already knows the pane's agent, so it resolves the adapter and
 * passes the capability down. It covers the echo the text comparison above cannot see at all: a
 * harness that collapses a long send into its own token (Claude's `[Pasted text #N +M lines]`) puts
 * something on the "❯" line that shares no characters with what we sent, so without this the preview
 * flashes the placeholder as a "stranded draft" during the send's grace window.
