// The Collie mascot doubling as the app's activity indicator: a 6-frame gallop sprite
// (public/dog-gallop.png — a 768×128 strip of six 128px cells, transparent background) stepped
// through with a pure-CSS steps(6) animation. No JS timers, no layout thrash, GPU-cheap — the whole
// cycle is one repainting background-position. It gallops while the app is loading/reconnecting
// (`running`); `prefers-reduced-motion` pins it to frame 0 (see index.css). `--dog-size` drives both
// the box and the sprite scale, so one length keeps them in lockstep at any placement.
//
// NOTE: NOTHING IN THE APP MOUNTS THIS ANY MORE. Every loading state — the header, the boot splash,
// the idle cover — is <CollieMark/> (components/collie-mark.tsx) at its bloom, so the app shows one
// animal in one drawing. The sprite is kept because it is still the mascot elsewhere; it is not a
// second activity indicator to reach for. If you do mount it, mount it with `running`: the
// `running={false}` rest frame is frame 0 of the gallop strip — a full-stretch mid-stride pose that
// reads as "frozen mid-run", not "at rest" — so this is never a rest state. The `running` default
// stays false only to preserve the reduced-motion contract.
