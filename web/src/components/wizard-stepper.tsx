// change, so a chip putting it on when it becomes current would grow and shove every chip after it
// along the strip. The final weight is shipped at rest and the state is carried by colour alone —
// the border, the tint and the text token below. Reserving the wider metric this way costs nothing;
// the idle chip is already held back far enough by `text-muted-foreground` on a bare border.
