// The prerelease marker: a thin amber strip across the top of the one header shell, saying which
// non-stable build you are looking at. It exists because a v1 alpha runs BESIDE the stable install on
// its own origin — same dog, same layout, different machine-eating capabilities — and "which tab is
// which" cannot be left to the operator's memory of a port number.
//
// Zero config: it keys off the version already baked into THIS bundle (lib/build.ts, a vite `define`)
// and renders only when that version carries a SemVer prerelease tag. A stable build has no tag, so
// prereleaseLabel returns undefined and this component is nothing at all — no flag, no fetch, no
// setting to forget to turn off.
//
// Colours are the shared `status-info` sky token, which is declared with `light-dark()` in
// index.css and therefore already correct under both themes — hence NO `dark:` variants here.
//
// This strip is the tightest contrast case in the app, because it is a translucent wash under its
// own solid ink and it inherits whatever the header is filled with. On the header's old `bg-muted`
// band (rgb 235) the `/15` chip measured 4.41:1 — under the 4.5 floor index.css claims for the
// token. The header is the page colour now (app-header.tsx), so the same pair reads 4.79:1 light
// and 8.40:1 dark. The margin in light is ~0.29 and that is the whole margin: do not re-tint the
// header behind this strip, and do not drop the wash below /15. Sky
// rather than the `status-working` amber deliberately: this strip isn't a warning, just a calm
// "you're on the prerelease build" fact. The treatment (border-b + /15 wash + solid token text) is
// deliberately the ReadOnlyBanner's, so the app's two "this session is not normal" strips read as
// one family.
