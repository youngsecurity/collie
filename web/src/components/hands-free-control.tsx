// The one voice SETTING (ADR 0029). Everything else about speech-to-text is an operator act on the
// keyboard — `collie stt setup` mints the credential, exactly as `collie pair` does — so this page
// carries the single question the phone gets to answer: does a finished transcript go into the
// message box, or straight out?
//
// DEFAULT OFF, and it stays a deliberate act. With it on, words nobody has read reach a real
// terminal; the send still takes the guarded reply path, but the review step is the operator, and
// this switch is where they waive it. The composer keeps two refusals the switch cannot express — a
// draft already in the box, and a password prompt on screen — and both fall back to inserting.
//
// Hidden where there is no microphone at all: no provider configured, or a browser that cannot
// record (an insecure origin has no `mediaDevices`). Same predicate as the composer's button, so the
// two can never disagree — a toggle for a feature that is absent teaches the user the app lies.
