/**
 * The top band, and the rule that there is only ever ONE strip in it.
 *
 * Today four strips can appear above the header independently — connection amber, connection red,
 * the auth refusal, the update offer — and none of them excludes another. Two of them at once cost
 * ~66px of a 390×844 phone and double the number of times the page moves, and every pair of them
 * has a strict "which of these matters more" answer anyway: amber behind red is strictly less
 * information than red alone. So the band arbitrates. The losing fact is not lost — the update
 * offer keeps its footer line and its settings control — it is only not shouted over a worse one.
 *
 * Arbitration here is height-invariant BY CONSTRUCTION, not by luck: every strip sits on the same
 * `min-h-[33px]` floor stated in `ui/notice.tsx`, so a replacement repaints the band and never
 * moves it. The band's height animates on APPEAR and on LEAVE, and at no other time.
 *
 * The host is domain-blind and tone-blind. It does not know what a connection is, it styles
 * nothing, and it announces nothing — the Notice inside carries its own `announce`. Priorities
 * reach it as plain numbers; the TABLE that names them belongs on the feature side, so that
 * "AUTH beats OUTAGE beats DEGRADED beats UPDATE" is a fact about this app rather than a fact
 * about `ui/`.

        classic way to ship a banner that no screen reader ever reads. These two are the band's
        permanent anchors: the host itself never unmounts, so a Notice appearing inside it is a
        change WITHIN a region that was already there, not the arrival of a new one.
        A role and nothing else — no `aria-live` beside it. `role="status"` already means polite
        and `role="alert"` already means assertive; writing both asks for two answers to one
        question, which is the contradiction ui/notice.tsx exists to make unwritable.

          looking at decides whether the band clears the notch. One owner, one answer — and it is
          the row, not the Notice, because it is a fact about the band's position in the viewport.

          All layers share ONE grid cell, so the band is as tall as the tallest of them and a swap
          cannot change its height even for a frame. The winner is opaque, the losers fade out under
          it — a dissolve inside the already-open Collapse, with no second height animation. The
          stacking itself is `ui/one-of.tsx`, which is where the same idiom now serves the composer's
          status slot; what stays here is what the band alone knows — which slot wins, how long the
          dissolve takes, and the ghost that keeps painting through the exit.
