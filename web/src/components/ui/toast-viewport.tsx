/**
 * Where a transient event floats. The overlay half of the alert system.
 *
 * The line the whole design turns on: a notice that will outlive the operator's next interaction
 * HOLDS SPACE; anything shorter floats. A standing condition costs space because it costs
 * capability — "you are read-only" gates the composer, and an overlay carrying that either sits
 * over the content for minutes or fades and leaves the operator with an inexplicably dead
 * composer. An event is the opposite: it passes on its own, so holding space for it means the
 * page moves twice for something that was true for two seconds. This component is for the second
 * kind, and it is the only layer in the app that is allowed to cover content.
 *
 * It owns POSITION and nothing else. What floats in it — the status line, its ground, its
 * dismissal — belongs to the feature that renders inside it.

/**
 * `pointer-events-none` on the wrapper, `pointer-events-auto` re-enabled by whatever inside is
 * actually meant to be tapped (today: the dismiss affordance on a persisting error). This is the
 * existing, correct pattern from `routes/home.tsx:121-123`, kept verbatim: an overlay that eats
 * taps over content it is only visiting is worse than the layout shift it replaced.
 *
 * `z-40` is the unclaimed rung of the ladder — above the `z-20` sticky header and everything else
 * in the app's chrome, below the `z-50` sheets and the idle lock. That places a toast where it
 * should be: visible over any chrome, occluded by a modal. A sheet is a focused task; a transient
 * toast may be missed during one, and an error that actually persists is still in the channel and
 * still showing when the sheet closes.
