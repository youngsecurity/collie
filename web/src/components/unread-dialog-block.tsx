// The UNREAD-DIALOG CARD — one declared key over a screen Collie could not read (.adr/0053).
//
// This is the least confident block in the family and it must look it. It claims nothing about the
// screen: no title lifted, no options, no footer parsed. The caption says what is true ("Collie
// cannot read this dialog") and the single button says only the KEY, never what the key does — on
// Muse that key steps back rather than dismisses, so a label promising "cancel" would be a lie on a
// real harness.
//
// The region is the WHOLE pane, mirrored verbatim BY DEFAULT — the screen is the only thing the
// operator has to read when nothing else is understood, so unlike the four cards that fully replace
// their region this one never hides it. Same treatment as menu-block.tsx: React text nodes only, and
// the agent's own terminal colours (MIRROR_SPACE / MIRROR_INVERT, ADR 0002), via the shared
// RawMirror. PromptPanel's own Terminal toggle (ADR 0056) still applies on top, for a decluttered
// view with the key control put away.
//
// DESIGN.md §2: the in-flight state recolours the button and changes NOTHING else — no spinner child
// appears, no border is added, no padding moves. The border is reserved in the base string and the
// pending state only repaints it, so the card the operator is reading does not shift under the tap.
// DESIGN.md §6: `min-h-11` is the 44px tap floor, stated as a floor and never a fixed height.
// ARM, THEN SEND (#339). The declared key is sent on the SECOND tap. A screen this card could not
// read may be a question dialog whose Escape ends the whole turn (opencode's `esc dismiss`), and
// the first tap must not be able to do that. The first tap only arms: the button's words change
// (never its size), and it disarms by itself after ARM_MS. The wording names "Dismiss" only when
// the screen's own rows print `esc dismiss`; otherwise it names the key, never a verb.
