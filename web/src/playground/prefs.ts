// Page-wide presentation prefs for the states playground. DEV-ONLY, like everything else here.
//
// WHY A MODULE STORE AND NOT STATE IN PlaygroundApp: three readers sit in three different trees —
// the root wrapper (applies the style), the sidebar Controls (offers the knobs), and the typeface
// card (whose switcher is the same choice with commentary attached). Threading props through
// BrandSection to reach the card is exactly the ceremony the harness's other global (the connection
// clock) already declined; same pattern here. Nothing persists: a dev page should open in the app's
// real dress every time, so the comparison always starts from truth.
//
// WHAT "APPLIED THROUGHOUT" MEANS. The chosen face lands on the playground root twice — as an
// inherited `font-family` for everything that just inherits (which is most text), and as a
// `--font-sans` override for anything that re-asserts the token. `font-mono` surfaces (the mirror,
// key caps) name their own family and are deliberately untouched. The accent overrides `--primary`/
// `--primary-foreground` the same way; every `bg-primary` button on the page resolves the token at
// its own element, so the override cascades to all of them without touching a component.
